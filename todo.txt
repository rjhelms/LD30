To do:

must haves!!!!:
	- level transitions
		- fade in/out with a message
	- beef up jungle level
	- music
	- game win/lose scenarios
	- intro screen?

fix: pathfinder idiocy
	- getting stuck in driveways? seems fixed

fix: screen tearing

nice to haves:
	- hideout behaviour - all cops immediately stop chasing, won't start again for some length of time
	- random destinations from a list
	- more sound?
	- more terrain
	- # of patrols tied to level
