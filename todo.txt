To do:

must haves!!!!:
	- level transitions
		- a message?
	- beef up jungle level
	- music
	- game win/lose scenarios
	- intro screen?

fix: compass texture for jungle scene
fix: screen tearing

nice to haves:
	- hideout behaviour - all cops immediately stop chasing, won't start again for some length of time
	- more sound?
	- more terrain
	- # of patrols tied to level

refactor: don't load extra patrols just to destroy them
