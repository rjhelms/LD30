To do:

must haves!!!!:
	- fix pathfinder
	- level transitions
		- fade in/out with a message
	- music
	- more sound

fix: pathfinder idiocy
	- behaviour at end of chase
	- getting stuck in driveways
fix: screen tearing
fix: movement - support arrow keys / azerty

nice to haves:
	- hideout behaviour - all cops immediately stop chasing, won't start again for some length of time
	- random destinations from a list

jungle level:

add goals
	- collect drugs
		- farms
	- get to airport

add other terrain etc

bad guys:
	- army patrols
		- when they sight player, chase him down
			- player can ditch them by getting to a hideout
			- should player have a boost, with limited capacity?

city level (in its entirety):
	- also driving?
	- all the sprites - also a car?
		- buildings etc etc
	- similar idea, find people to sell, get out of there



level progression:
	- more to collect
	- more/faster bad guys
